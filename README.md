# Gravity-Bone AutoSplitter 1.0
#### This AutoSplitter works correctly if you start a new game.
## Current Issues:
* No load remover implemented
* If you load a savegame of the first level the timer will restart
* If you load a savegame of the second level the timer will not start
Last 2 issues are less important of course.
I have also added one split for every bird photograph ( users can disable every split except the first and the last one ).
